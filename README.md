# <img src="images/lorekeel.png" alt="Lorekeel" width="32"> Outcasts Lorekeel — a GM that never forgets or contradicts

A TRPG game master with a cloud LLM as narrator and a **deterministic Rust engine as the source of truth** for game state.

The failure mode that always breaks AI Dungeon–style LLM GMs isn't weak prose — it's **forgetting and contradiction** (what you carry, who died, where you are, what was decided last turn). Lorekeel cuts that off structurally: the LLM never holds the state. What it sells is not "infinite freedom" but **consistency**.

A side effect of that architecture: because the engine guarantees correctness, Lorekeel runs well on **cheap, free, or fully local models**. The engine backs up a small model's mistakes, so you don't need a frontier model to get a coherent game — only richer prose.

*A scenario package in play — the GM's narration over a scene background, with live goals and the characters present in the scene on the right. Everything is driven by the deterministic engine underneath.*

## Download

Get the installer for your OS from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/betyourluck/Lorekeel/releases/latest).

| OS | File | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | `Lorekeel_x.y.z_x64-setup.exe` (installer) / `.msi` | ✅ Verified working |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `.dmg` / Homebrew | Signed & notarized from v0.5.16; app itself unverified |
| Linux | `.deb` / `.AppImage` / `.rpm` | CI build only, unverified |

On macOS you can install it with Homebrew instead:

```sh
brew install --cask betyourluck/tap/lorekeel
```

The fully qualified name is not optional — tapping a repository does not grant Homebrew
permission to load code from it. Apple Silicon only; there is no Intel build.
`brew uninstall --cask lorekeel` leaves your saves, packages and API keys in place
(`--zap` deletes those too).

After launching, go to **Settings → AI Model** and set the `base_url` / `model` / `api_key` for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (a cloud LLM, or a local OpenAI-compatible server). Play scenario packages by adding a folder or fetching them from the distribution site.

## Design core — separation of powers

> **The LLM proposes, the engine adjudicates, Memoria remembers, the scenario constrains.**

| Branch | Role | Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Engine (source of truth)** | Deterministically adjudicates every mutable state — HP/stats, inventory, dice, flags, location, skills, attributes | `crates/gm_core` (Rust) | ✅ Done |
| **LLM (proposal)** | Narration, NPC lines, action proposals. Holds no numeric truth (structurally can't) | `crates/llm_client` (Rust) | ✅ Done — 4 wire formats (OpenAI-compatible / Anthropic / Gemini / OpenAI Responses) |
| **Memoria (memory)** | Semantic recall of foreshadowing & character personality (never mutable state) | `crates/harness` (memoria_bridge) | ✅ Done |
| **Scenario (constraint)** | A location graph + gate conditions keep improvisation on the rails | YAML packages | ✅ Done |

**Iron rule:** mutable world state lives in the engine's state machine. It is **never** placed in vector recall — fuzzy recall would recreate the "forgetting GM." Only foreshadowing and personality belong to Memoria.

## What the engine guarantees

The LLM proposes a `StateDelta` (structured output: `narration` + `ops`). The engine's `adjudicate` — a pure function that changes no state — verifies every op; on an illegal op it rejects with a machine-readable reason and the loop regenerates. Only on acceptance does `apply` mutate state, **atomically** (one bad op rejects the whole delta; state stays intact).

Because of that boundary:

- **Numbers are the engine's.** The LLM states the intent ("train hard: +STR, −HP"); the engine does the arithmetic. It cannot fabricate a die roll, an HP value, or an item it doesn't hold — the op structure makes it impossible.
- **Dice are deterministic & auditable** (seeded RNG). Same seed → same rolls.
- **Closed world.** Undeclared stats / items / skills / flags don't exist; the engine rejects any op that touches them. Skills, character classes, and who-is-present change only through authored triggers, never LLM whim.
- **Consequence is authored.** Named goals, campaign transitions (state carries across modules), challenges (dice → tiers → flags), delayed events, and hidden roles + voting (werewolf-style) are all gated by the engine, not the prose.
- **Long memory.** A running chronicle and compressed chapter synopses feed the GM its own past, so it stays consistent across long sessions — the second half of "never forgets."

## Proven with real LLMs, across genres

The same unchanged engine drives fantasy dungeons, dating-sim routes (raising a heroine's affection), mystery, and social deduction (a hidden-werewolf village). The engine is genre-neutral; the LLM supplies the flavor. Verified end-to-end with **Claude, Gemini, Grok, OpenAI, Meta, and Perplexity (Agent API via `/v1/responses`)**, and with local OpenAI-compatible servers via a **no-tools JSON mode** (for models that don't support tool calling). Prompt caching (Anthropic `cache_control` / Gemini `cachedContent` / xAI sticky routing) keeps the repeated input cheap.

The signature demonstration: tell the GM you use a "prophecy skill you never had," and it grounds the lie away — *"there was never such a power"* — with zero state change. **The source of truth beats the LLM's fluency.**

## Authoring & distribution

Scenarios ship as self-contained **packages** — a folder with `package.yaml` + characters + scenarios (+ optional campaign, images, audio). Zip it, unzip it, it runs. A companion distribution site (the *書庫*) lets authors share packages and players install them from inside the app. You can even build a package by handing an LLM the format spec and a synopsis; see the authoring guide.

## Build & test

```bash
cargo test --workspace                     # 250+ deterministic PoC tests (Red→Green)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
```

The desktop app (Tauri 2 + Vue 3) lives in `app/`:

```bash
cd app && npm install && npm run tauri dev  # requires WebView2 on Windows
```
